	curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
	More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

	curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
	establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
	how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
